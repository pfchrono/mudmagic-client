1.7-rev-a
---------
* Aug 2005
 - Calvin Ellis <kyndig@mudmagic.com>
        - modified mudmagic.h to use the python detection routine of
          configure for compiling on different platforms.
          [ src/script/script.h ]
        - modified plugins to use a GTK_GREATHER_THAN instead of HAVE_WINDOWS
          in order to use the toolbar_modify function on linux distro's
          with a version of Gtk greater than 2.2
          [ plugins-extra/database.c plugins-extra/notes.c configure.in ]
	- moved the compiling of plugins to its own Makefile.am in the
	  plugins-extra directory and added in some linking. This still
	  needs some cleaning up though
	- removed a small glitch that was preventing the download of the
	  game listings from mudmagic website
	- Packaged for stock Fedora Core 4. Rebundled source distro and
	  re-releasing under 1.7. ( compiles out of the box on GCC 4.x now)

1.7
-------
* July 2005
 - Tomas Mecir  <kmuddy@kmuddy.net>
	- aliases & triggers now support command line input
	  in the input area of the respective windows. Anything
	  placed in this command window is sent directly to the
	  client as input
	- MXP support has been initiated. Current supported tags
	  are Anchor, font coloring/modifying, image use and a few
	  others.
	- added: alias_triggers.c, removed them from the python
	  scripting
	- added variables.c for the beginning placement of MXP
	  variables
	- incorporated Tomas Mecir's LIBMXP to the client to handle
	  all MXP routines.
 - Calvin Kyndig Ellis <kyndig@mudmagic.com>
	- modified configuration files for linux. This still needs
	  additional work; as now the plugins are compiled with
	  the client..and this shouldn't be (see: TODO)
	- bundled: SQLite 2.8, LibMXP, Zlib, and PCRE with the client
	  now. This bundling removes all needed server-side libs for
	  installation of the client, with the exception of the standard
	  Gtk libraries. The client should now work on any Linux distro
	  that is using Gtk 2.2 or greater
	- recompiled all bundled DLL for windows, created simple Makefile's
	  for window compiling. See respective Makefile.win for instructions
	  (these need updating: see TODO)
	- repackaged Fedora release with all supportive libs compiled
	  in. A binary install should work on any Fedora/RedHat release now.
	- removed an unreleased call for the Gnome library, and replaced
	  it with Gtk specific code to handle the opening of a web browser
	  when a link is clicked on. ( We can't use Gnome libs, as gnome is
	  not ported to windows )
	- added strings.c and strings.h for a safer routine in string
	  management
	- modified updating of game list details in the wizard. The wizard
	  now uses Gzip to download and decompress a compressed .gz game
	  list. This makes updating the wizard with the latest games in the
	  database faster.
	- Disabled MACRO usage for now. A bug with the new trigger/alias
	  system is causing it to fail. ( see: TODO )
