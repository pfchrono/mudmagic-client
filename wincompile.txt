How to compile the MudMagic source code on windows platform:
This is using the MinGW build platform and latest GTK+
libraries.
===========================================================

PHASE 1 - prepare the environment

    1. Install MinGW
	  install MinGW using the MinGW wizard from:
           http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/mingw/MinGW-5.0.2.exe?download
         When running the install:
            -select download as needed and install [NEXT]
            -select current [NEXT]
            -select 'MinGW base tools' and 'MinGW Make'  [NEXT]
            -install in: C:\MinGW

	  install MinGW MSYS frontend
           http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/mingw/MSYS-1.0.10.exe?download
	   When running the install:
             -when you get to the destination directory MAKE SURE TO SET IT TO
              C:\MinGW  ( do NOT set it to anything else - it's best to just copy/paste this in)
              You will get a warning that the directory already exists, select YES to install anyway
             -at the end of the install, a DOS window asks you to input y or n. Hit: y
              AND y again when it asks if you have MinGW installed. Then input: c:\MinGW when prompted
              to input your mingw installation location

         install the MinGW mysys Developers Kit for cvs,automake and other packages
           http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/mingw/msysDTK-1.0.1.exe?download
	   When running the install:
             -when you get to the destination directory MAKE SURE TO SET IT TO
              C:\MinGW  ( do NOT set it to anything else - it's best to just copy/paste this in)

      That's it. You now have MinGW set up to compile the software.

    2. Prepare the GTK environment for compiling the software.
 
       Download the following 2 packages.
       http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/gladewin32/gtk-win32-devel-2.8.18-rc1.exe?download
       http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/gladewin32/gtk-win32-2.8.18-rc1.exe?download
       http://www.python.org/ftp/python/2.3.4/Python-2.3.4.exe
       http://www.mudmagic.com/mud-client/mm-setupfiles.zip

       The first file is the Developer libraries, used to compile the software. The second file
       is the 'runtime' DLL's that will be used by the program once you compile it. For later
       updates, always make sure you get the same runtime environment as the development environment
       or odd things happen.

       - Run the gtk-win32-devel program first. Install it in: 
         C:\GTK

       - Run the gtk-win32 program next. Install it in:
         C:\Gtk-Runtime  ( it default to c:\gtk, MAKE SURE TO CHANGE IT )
         When it asks you for the program name, it defaults to Gtk+, change this to Gtk2

       - Run the Python-2.3.4.exe and install it in:  C:\Python23

       - Extract the mm-setupfiles.zip into: C:\Gtk-Runtime
         ( the mm-setupfiles.zip contains gtk themes, and the current interface/ directory
           as of this writing. Future modifications of interface/ will require the interface/
           and doc/ directories to be updated appropriately )

    3. Compiling the Program

       - Close or minimise all windows. At this time, you can clean up the extra files that this process
         has installed on your desktop. All the tar.gz files, the install files, and the mingw file with a
         socket on it can be safely removed. Do NOT REMOVE the MSYS blue icon. =)
 
       - On your desktop, click on the MSYS icon. A bash shell
         will appear.

	 - Retrieve the MudMagic Client through CVS using the bash shell of your MSYS
           TYPE IN THE FOLLOWING IN BASH SHELL:
         #set up the bash compile environment
export PATH=$PATH:/c/GTK/bin
export PKG_CONFIG_PATH=/c/GTK/lib/pkgconfig
export PKG_CONFIG=/c/GTK/bin/pkg-config.exe
export GTK_BASEPATH=/c/GTK/share/aclocal
export PYTHON_LIBS=/c/Python23/libs
export PYTHON_CFLAGS=-I/c/Python23/include
export PATH=$PATH:/c/GTK/bin:/c/Python23

export CVSROOT=:pserver:anonymous@mudmagic.com:/cvs/mudmagic
cvs login
cvs co mudmagic_client

      - You need the sqlite3.dll from the file you just extracted in C:\Gtk-Runtime . 
        * go to: Start -> MyComputer -> C -> Gtk-Runtime directory. COPY sqlite3.dll
        * go to: C -> MinGW -> home -> YourLogin -> mudmagic_client -> bundled -> sqlite3
          and PASTE the file you copied into that directory ( overwrite the old one )

      - Go back into your MSYS bash shell
cd mudmagic_client/src

mingw32-make -f Makefile.win
         
      - Thats it! It should have compiled fine. If not, make sure you followed everything above.

   4. Finish setting up the Gtk-Runtime Directory and test the client
      - After compiling, you'll need to move the src/mudmagic.exe file to your C:\Gtk-Runtime folder
        * Start -> My Computer -> C -> MinGW -> home -> Your Login -> mudmagic_client -> src
          right-click and COPY the mudmagic icon
        * browse to: C -> Gtk-Runtime
          PASTE the mudmagic.exe file you just copied
      - Go into: C -> Gtk-Runtime -> bin folder and SELECT ALL. Then CUT. Then browse up one folder to Gtk-Runtime
        Paste all the files you just cut from bin/ directory into the Gtk-Runtime folder.

      - You should now have everything you need to simply click on the mudmagic icon and the client will start

   5. If you make changes to the code after all this. The only steps you need to perform AFTER you recompile
      your code changes are the take the mudmagic.exe file and place it in Gtk-Runtime directory.

OLDER UNUSED INSTRUCTIONS FOR DEV-CPP

    * step 1 - DEV-CPP
        - URL: http://www.bloodshed.net/dev/devcpp.html
        - install it in c:\devcpp
        - add $DEVCPP_PATH/bin in PATH  (in my case
          PATH=c:\devcpp\bin;%PATH%a   )

    * step 2 - PYTHON
        - URL: http://www.python.org/ftp/python/2.3.4/Python-2.3.4.exe
        - install it  c:\python

    * step 3 - GTK+ development environment
	       This step sets up the environment for compiling the mud client in DOS. The next step (step 4)
	       sets up the environment for creating the installer program to install the mudmagic client. (don't
	       confuse these two steps and their purposes =)

	       *Download the following files. Extract all these files to: c:\GTK . This will be the header library
		used to compiled the mud client.

		-URL: ftp://ftp.gtk.org/pub/gtk/v2.8/win32/gtk+-dev-2.8.6.zip
		-URL: ftp://ftp.gtk.org/pub/gtk/v2.8/win32/pango-dev-1.10.1.zip
	        -URL: ftp://ftp.gtk.org/pub/gtk/v2.8/win32/glib-dev-2.8.3.zip
		-URL: ftp://ftp.gtk.org/pub/gtk/v2.8/win32/cairo-dev-1.0.2.zip
		-URL: ftp://ftp.gtk.org/pub/gtk/v2.8/win32/atk-dev-1.10.3.zip
		-URL: http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/gladewin32/libglade-2.4.0-dev.zip
		-URL: http://www.gimp.org/~tml/gimp/win32/gettext-dev-0.14.5.zip

	       *Bundled packages - The following packages contain both developmental headers for step 3, and
		precompiled libs for step 4. In this part, just extract the contents in a seperate folder and copy/paste
 		everything to your c:\GTK folder. (leave extracted folder for portions of step 4 if needed)
		
		libiconv:
			http://www.gimp.org/~tml/gimp/win32/libiconv-1.9.1.bin.woe32.zip
		
   *  step 4 - Prepare the gtk-runtime-installer. This uses GAIM's and GIMP's aproach at handling
	       registry usage on 98, 2k, xp, and NT platforms. Neither of these distro's are currently
	       using a 2.8.6 version though - so this installer was created. Normally I just use GAIM's
               gtk-runtime.exe installer they distro with their program.

	       NOTE: This is put here for development education purposes. Only the person responsible for
		     the initial release of the mud client (Kyndig) has to perform these steps. All other
		     users can download the completed gtk-runtime.exe file, along with the current NSI
		     system for creating the 'setup' process of the mud client from the CVS client_installer
		     located at cvs.mudmagic.com . Only use this step if you require an updated gtk+ version.

	
		
       		* Retrieve gaim's gtk_installer and extract it to c:\ (as of this writing, 2.6.9 was the
		 latest gaim gtk-installer ..we need one for version 2.8.6, so well use this one as a template )
		
		-URL: http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/gaim/gtk-2.6.9-rev-a-installer.tar.gz
			*GO INTO gtk_installer/gtk_install_files and DELETE EVERYTHING (select all-delete)

		* go into the libiconv folder you left from step-3 and copy the bin/ to the gtk_installer/gtk_install_files
 		  directory

	       * Retrieve the following libs and extract them all under the previous gtk_installer/gtk_install_files
		 rather than recompiling all this above. Download the appropriate dll files that correspond
	 	 to the above versions and drop them into the directory whose content we just deleted. This runtime
		 also includes glade dll since we need it for the mud client. (DO NOT USE gladewin32 site! it does
		 not follow the gaim/gimp registry and will break those installs as well as the mudmagic install)

		-URL: ftp://ftp.gtk.org/pub/gtk/v2.8/win32/gtk+-2.8.6.zip
		-URL: ftp://ftp.gtk.org/pub/gtk/v2.8/win32/pango-1.10.1.zip
		-URL: ftp://ftp.gtk.org/pub/gtk/v2.8/win32/glib-2.8.3.zip
		-URL: ftp://ftp.gtk.org/pub/gtk/v2.8/win32/atk-1.10.3.zip
		-URL: ftp://ftp.gtk.org/pub/gtk/v2.8/win32/cairo-1.0.2.zip
		-URL: http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/gladewin32/libglade-2.4.0-bin.zip
		-URL: http://www.gimp.org/~tml/gimp/win32/gettext-0.14.5.zip

	      * The following files are not required to compile the mud client, but the dll's are required to operate
		certain things in GTK. download and copy these dll's to the gtk_install_files/bin directory:
		-URL: http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/gnuwin32/libpng-1.2.8-bin.zip?download

	      * The following files are not distributed by default with gaim or gimp, and are not need to compile the
		mud client, but _are_ needed for certain functionality of the client. These files should be placed in
		the mud clients: windows-installer/installs file as their extracted dll parts:
		-URL: http://www.zlib.net/zlib123-dll.zip

		
		* Edit gtk-installer.nsi script. Near the top add:
			;Configuration
			!define GTK_VERSION "2.8.6"
			!define GTK_REVISION "a"

		* Drag-n-Drop the gtk-installer.nsi file to your NSIS Compiler window to create gtk-runtime.exe installer.
		* Move this executable to the mudmagic contrib/windows-installer/gtk_installer  directory
		* gaim & gimp don't use glade, so just to be safe for future updates, copy the libglade-2.0.0.dll file
		  to mudmagics gtk_install directory (the nsi script is already setup to install it)

PHASE 2 - build 
		- untar mudmagic-1.7.tar.gz
		- go into each one of the mudmagic-1.7/bundled directories and
		  compile the DLL if you wish to. You can use the pre-compiled
		  DLL's though that come with the client. Read the win32/Makefile.win
		  in the appropriate bundled library to compile the dll
		- cd in mudmagic-1.7/src/main
		- edit mudmagic-1.7/src/main/Makefile.win to point to your: python/ devextra/ and devcpp/ directories
		- make -f Makefile.win
		- copy the mudmagic.exe in mudmagic-1.7/contrib/windows-installer/installs directory
				
PHASE 3 - build the new setup program
		- cd in mudmagic-1.7/contrib/windows-installer
		- run mudmagic.nsi script to produce a new Setup1.7.exe file

~                            
script to produce a new mudmagic-1.7.exe file

~
